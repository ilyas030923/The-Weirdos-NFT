# The-Weirdos-NFT

This project was built using React JS and Styled Components to create a website for a fictional NFT project called "The Weirdos". The website is a single page application that showcases the NFT collection, the team behind the project, and the roadmap. The website also includes a minting section where users can mint their own NFTs. The website is fully responsive and has a smooth scroll effect.
